The Energy Gateway communicates directly with PV-inverters or battery storage systems through the use of the Modbus protocol, allowing for the transfer of data and control signals between the device and the energy generation or storage system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/executive-summery":{"id":"whitepaper/executive-summery","title":"Executive Summary","description":"Sourceful primarily exists to accelerate and facilitate the expansion of renewable energy sources. The main problems that Sourceful aims to address are the critical challenge in the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as solar PV, into the electrical grid. More and more households are investing in solar panels and home batteries which is fantastic for the climate transition. But these resources are not used to their full potential. Today renewable production is destabilising the power grid due to its unreliable nature. Small scale solar panels and batteries are not used as a resource for mitigating this. Sourceful aims to become a decentralized, community-driven Virtual Power Plant (VPP) utilizing Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). These resources will be connected through the user-friendly Sourceful Energy Gateway, facilitating a cooperative and efficient energy management system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/potential":{"id":"whitepaper/potential","title":"Potential","description":"Sourceful offers a decentralized energy system that utilizes blockchain, distributed energy resources, and the Internet of Things to revolutionize the energy industry. The possibilities of this innovative technology extend far beyond the current energy market, and the Sourceful platform can be used in a variety of different ways. On this page, we\'ll explore three potential use cases for the Sourceful system: flexibility services, guarantee of origin, and peer-to-peer energy trading. Each of these use cases demonstrates the power and potential of the Sourceful platform to drive the transition towards renewable energy and a more sustainable future.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/problems-to-solve":{"id":"whitepaper/problems-to-solve","title":"Problems to Solve","description":"Sourceful aims to address several key challenges in the energy market, including barriers to entry, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology and costs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/solution":{"id":"whitepaper/solution","title":"The Solution","description":"Remove barriers to enter","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"whitepaper/team":{"id":"whitepaper/team","title":"Vision","description":"We\'re living in the age of exponential growth for solar and batteries.
