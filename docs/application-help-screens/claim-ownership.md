# Claiming Gateway Ownership

## Important Notice

⚠️ **Gateway ownership is permanent and currently non-transferable**. Make absolutely sure you are using the correct Solana wallet before proceeding.

## What Happens When You Claim Ownership

When you claim ownership of a gateway:
- The gateway is permanently linked to your Solana wallet
- You become eligible for rewards and incentives
- You gain access to gateway configuration options

## Verification Steps

Before claiming ownership:

1. **Check Your Wallet**
   - Verify you are connected to the correct Solana wallet
   - Double-check the public key displayed
   - Make sure this is the wallet you want to use long-term

2. **Verify Gateway Details**
   - Confirm the gateway ID matches your device
   - Check that the gateway is unclaimed
   - Ensure you have physical access to the device

3. **Sign the Message**
   - Review the ownership claim message carefully
   - Verify all details before signing
   - Use your wallet to sign the transaction

## Troubleshooting

If you see an error:
- **Already Claimed**: The gateway is already linked to another wallet
- **Connection Error**: Check your internet connection
- **Wallet Error**: Make sure your wallet is unlocked and accessible
- **Signature Failed**: Try the signing process again

## After Claiming

Once ownership is successfully claimed:
1. The gateway will be linked to your wallet
2. You'll proceed to location assertion
3. You can then configure your inverter settings
