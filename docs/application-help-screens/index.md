   - Locate an available Ethernet port on your router
   - Connect one end of the Ethernet cable to your gateway
   - Connect the other end to your router
   - Check that the network indicator light activates
   - Let the Energy Gateway fetch the latest firmware
      - This process takes about **10-15 minutes**

   **Wireless**
   - Proceed to the next step in the configuration process and follow the guides
   - When having set up a WiFi connection, let the Energy Gateway fetch the latest firmware before proceeding
