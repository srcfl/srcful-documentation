# Archive

This section preserves legacy materials that are no longer part of the primary Developer Portal navigation.

Archived topics include:
- Whitepaper drafts and token reward models
- Tokenomics (beta points, rewards, incentives)
- Sustainability reports and SDG materials
- Misc. beta program documents

Content remains available for reference and historical context but is intentionally excluded from the main sidebar to keep the developer documentation focused and professional.

If you need to restore any page to active docs, move it out of `docs/archive/` and update the sidebar as needed.
