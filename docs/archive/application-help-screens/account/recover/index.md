# Recover an account

If you have been using the Sourceful wallet in the past, you can recover your account here. We do not store any personal information server-side, so we cannot recover your account for you. 

To recover your account, you will need:

- The Access Key you got when you first onboarded to Sourceful
- Physical access to one of the Energy Gateways connected to your account

## Recover your account

Recover your account by filling in the access key in the form or, if the key is stored in Apples Keychain or Android Keystore, it will be automatically detected.

If the key is prefilled but you want to use a different key, you can manually enter the key in the field.

## What happens next?

When you have entered the key and pared blueetooth with the Energy Gateway you can continue to the next step. The Gateways will then sign a message on the device the app will send to the server for validation if your Energy Gateway and Access key are valid and match. In that case, your access key will be used to recover your account from the server.
