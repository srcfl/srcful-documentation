# Network Device Discovery Guide

## Overview
Your Energy Gateway has the capability to automatically discover compatible energy devices across your local network. This feature streamlines the setup process and enables seamless integration of your energy management system.

## Compatible Devices
The automatic discovery scan can detect:
- Solar inverters
- Battery systems
- Smart meters
- Other Decentralized Energy Resources (DERs)

## Important Considerations

### Network Impact
While the scanning process is designed to be network-friendly, please be aware that:
- Network performance may be temporarily affected during the scan
- Some inverter models might become briefly inaccessible to other devices
- These effects are temporary and typically resolve shortly after the scan completes

### Recommendations
Running the automatic discovery scan is highly recommended for:
- Achieving the most seamless setup experience
- Ensuring all compatible devices are properly identified
- Minimizing manual configuration requirements

### Alternative Setup Options
While automatic discovery is recommended, manual device configuration options are available for cases where:
- Automatic scanning is not preferred
- Specific devices need custom configuration
- Network policies restrict automatic discovery

## Best Practices
1. Schedule the scan during low-network-usage periods
2. Ensure all devices are powered on and connected to the network
3. Allow the scan to complete without interruption
4. Document any devices that require manual configuration
