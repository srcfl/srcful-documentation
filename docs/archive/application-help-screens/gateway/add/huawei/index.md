# Huawei FusionSolar Integration Help

## Prerequisites
Before starting the integration process with Sourceful Energy, please ensure you have:

1. A Huawei FusionSolar Owner account
   - **Important**: You must have an Owner account, not an Installer account
   - Owner accounts have full access rights necessary for the integration
   - Installer accounts have different permissions and won't work for this integration

2. The exact physical location of your inverter installation
   - This is required for proper system configuration
   - You'll need to mark this on the map in the next step

## Creating a Huawei FusionSolar Owner Account

1. Visit the [Huawei FusionSolar Portal](https://eu5.fusionsolar.huawei.com)
2. Click "Register" in the top right corner
3. Select "Plant Owner" as your account type
4. Fill in your details and complete the registration process
5. Verify your email address through the confirmation link

**Note**: If you already have an Installer account, you'll need to create a separate Owner account or contact Huawei Support to upgrade your permissions.

## Account Verification
To verify you have the correct account type:
1. Log in to FusionSolar
2. Go to your profile settings
3. Check that your account type is listed as "Owner"

## Next Steps
Once you have confirmed your Owner account status and know your inverter location:
1. Click the "Mark Location" button above
2. Follow the prompts to complete the backend setup
3. Link your FusionSolar account
4. Set up the cloud gateway
5. Grant necessary app permissions
