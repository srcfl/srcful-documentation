# Setting Your Gateway Location

## Why Location Matters

Accurate location data is crucial for your Energy Gateway's operation:

- **Solar Production Forecasting**: Enables precise solar production forecasts based on your exact geographical location
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare your system's performance with similar installations in your area
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures compliance with local energy regulations and grid requirements
- **Future Features**: Enables upcoming features like local energy trading and grid services

## How to Set Location

1. **Allow Location Access**
   - When prompted, allow the app to access your location
   - This helps center the map on your current area
   - You can still manually adjust the position if needed

2. **Position the Pin**
   - Drag the map to position the red pin exactly where your solar installation is located
   - Use two fingers to rotate and tilt the map for better visibility
   - The pin should be placed at your inverter's physical location

3. **Fine-tune with Zoom**
   - Use the + and - buttons to zoom in and out
   - Zoom in close enough to clearly identify your building
   - Higher zoom levels provide better location accuracy

## Tips for Accuracy

- **Use Satellite View**: Identify your roof or installation area more easily
- **Check Coordinates**: Verify the latitude and longitude shown at the bottom
- **Be Precise**: Take time to position the pin as accurately as possible
- **Verify Address**: Cross-reference with your installation address

## Important Notes

- Location data is stored securely and used only for system optimization
- You can update the location later if needed through gateway settings
- Accurate location data is required for optimal system performance
- The location is verified and stored on the blockchain for transparency

> For optimal performance and accurate energy forecasting, please ensure the pin is placed exactly where your solar installation is located.
