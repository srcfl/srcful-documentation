## How to Earn Rewards

In a gesture of appreciation and recognition for the active beta testers and early adopters, who have actively engaged during the dawn of the project, Sourceful has implemented a Beta Rewards program.


During this phase, the pool of beta tokens will be set at 20 million Beta Points per month. Beta testers will share this pool and be rewarded based on their uptime for the previous month. Each beta tester's share of the beta reward pool will be proportional to their individual uptime relative to the total uptime of all beta testers.


A minimum of 15 days uptime per month qualifies for rewards during the Beta.
Our tokenomics model will enhance the effectiveness of the network.

## Mainnet Rewards

Initially, the token allocation will incentivize the setup of Sourceful Energy Gateways and the connection of distributed energy resources (DERs). This approach aims to quickly expand our network's infrastructure, creating a robust foundation for the world's largest decentralized virtual power plant.

As our network grows, the token distribution will gradually shift towards rewarding the efficient control and utilization of these resources. This transition is designed to enhance the effectiveness of the energy network, encouraging participants to not just deploy resources, but to actively start participating in various energy services depending on current customer demand.
