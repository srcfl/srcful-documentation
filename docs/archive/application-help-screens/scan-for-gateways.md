# Connecting to Your Gateway

## Enabling Bluetooth Pairing Mode

1. **Locate the Pairing Button**
   - Find the small button on the side of your gateway located next to the USB-C power port

2. **Activate Pairing Mode**
   - Double click the button in **quick** succession
   - The gateway is now in Bluetooth pairing mode for 3 minutes


## Finding Your Gateway

Once in pairing mode:
- Your gateway will appear in the list of available devices
- Tap the + icon next to your gateway to connect

## Troubleshooting

If your gateway doesn't appear:
1. **Check Pairing Mode**
   - Click the button in **quick** succession several times
   - After powering the gateway pairing mode is active for some time without the need for clicking the button.

2. **Check Phone Settings**
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your phone
   - Allow the app to access Bluetooth when prompted
   - Keep your phone within 10 feet of the gateway

3. **Reset Bluetooth**
   - Turn Bluetooth off and on in your phone settings
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Try pairing mode again

4. **Gateway Issues**
   - Ensure the gateway is powered (green or red LED should be on)
   - If no LEDs are lit, check the power connection
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting power

> Note: Pairing mode times out after 3 minutes. If needed, press the button again to reactivate pairing mode.

## Next Steps

After successful connection:
- The app will automatically proceed to network setup
- Keep your phone near the gateway during configuration
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup
