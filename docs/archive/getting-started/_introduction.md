# Introduction to Sourceful

Welcome to the Sourceful Getting Started guide! Sourceful is a decentralized Virtual Power Plant using an Energy Gateway with a token-based incentive model for crowdsourcing at scale!

At its core, Sourceful mission is to create the worlds largest community-powered virtual power plant (VPP) through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs). This allows individuals to take control of their energy resources, contribute to the grid, and shape the development of next-generation energy services. By injecting decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies, we aim to unleash innovation and make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted by the people.

Join us in creating a more sustainable and decentralized energy system with Sourceful.
