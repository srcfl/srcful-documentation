# Introduction

## HIP 128: Energy Subnetwork

Sourceful has introduced a [**Helium Improvement Proposal**](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0128-energy-subnetwork.md) (HIP) that aims to create **ENERGY**, a new subnetwork within the [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) ecosystem. This innovative subnetwork focuses on rewarding users who participate in solar power production and battery energy storage, enhancing the integration of renewable energy resources. 

By enabling dual mining for existing compatible Helium Hotspots, allowing for both IOT and ENERGY rewards, the ENERGY subnetwork will utilize Helium’s IoT infrastructure to transfer vital sensor data, drive increased Data Credit (DC) burn, and contribute to grid stability.

Our proposal aim to leverage Helium’s decentralized model to create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) from small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), empowering homeowners and expanding Helium’s market reach. This initiative aligns with global sustainability goals and promises significant economic benefits, positioning both Sourceful and Helium at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution.

## Sourceful HIP Insights

In addition to our HIP, we will continuously be releasing **HIP Insights**, with the purpose of even further describing and explaining our proposal, the markets we are tapping into, and the reasoning leading up to our decisions in our HIP.

See our [**HIP Insights**](./insights/overview).


## Helium Community

All Helium Improvement Proposals are openly discussed and voted on by the Helium community. This collaborative process ensures that each proposal is thoroughly vetted and reflects the collective input and consensus of the community. By participating in these discussions and votes, community members play a crucial role in shaping the future of the Helium network.

Join the [**Helium Community Discord**](https://discord.gg/helium) to join in on the discussions.

## Learn more

To gain a deeper understanding of HIP 128, we recommend watching the podcasts listed below, where some of the proposal's authors discuss the HIP in detail. These podcast episodes, by **State of the Network** and **Proof of Coverage**, provide comprehensive insights into the proposal's objectives, benefits, and implementation strategies.

Listening to these episodes will provide a thorough understanding of how HIP 128 aims to enhance the Helium ecosystem and its potential impact on the network and its users.
