# UN SDGs 2030 Agenda

Sourceful is committed to achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our decentralized energy system is designed to help create a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient energy system that benefits everyone. Through our innovative use of blockchain technology, we aim to make energy production and consumption more transparent, reliable, and accessible.

Our mission aligns with the SDGs, which are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. At Sourceful, we are focused on [SDG7](./sdg7/), which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. We also contribute to [SDG9](./sdg9/), which seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation. In addition, we are dedicated to supporting [SDG11](./sdg11), which calls for sustainable cities and communities. By providing a decentralized, sustainable energy system, we aim to help build more resilient, efficient, and livable communities while reducing the environmental impact of energy production and consumption.

By encouraging the use of renewable energy sources and creating a more flexible and decentralized energy grid, we hope to help reduce global carbon emissions, increase energy access, and promote sustainable economic growth. We believe that our platform can play an important role in achieving the SDGs and creating a more sustainable and equitable world for all.

## SDG1 - No Poverty

SDG1, or No Poverty, is a global call to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions. At Sourceful, we believe that access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is a key factor in reducing poverty. By enabling individuals and communities to take control of their energy resources, we are empowering them to reduce their energy costs and improve their economic situation. Our platform supports the growth of renewable energy sources, which can provide energy access to communities that may not have had access before. Through our work, we hope to contribute to the achievement of SDG1 and create a more equitable and sustainable world.

## SDG2 - Zero Hunger

SDG2, which is aimed at ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture, is also an important goal that Sourceful contributes to. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources, we can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, which has a significant impact on food security and agriculture. Furthermore, our platform can empower individuals and communities to take control of their energy resources and improve access to energy in rural and underserved areas, which can help drive economic growth and increase food security. Through our efforts to create a more sustainable energy system, we hope to contribute to SDG2 and help create a more equitable and food-secure future for all.

## SDG3 - Good Helth and Well-being

SDG3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. At Sourceful, we recognize the critical role that access to reliable and sustainable energy plays in achieving this goal. With our decentralized energy system, we aim to provide individuals and communities with greater control over their energy resources, enabling them to power their homes, schools, hospitals, and other essential services.

By reducing reliance on centralized energy providers and promoting the use of renewable energy sources, we can help reduce air pollution and improve overall public health. Additionally, our platform can support the integration of emerging technologies, such as electric vehicles and smart batteries for energy storage, providing more flexible and resilient energy systems that can better respond to the needs of healthcare facilities and other critical services.

## SDG4 - Quality Education

SDG4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. While Sourceful's primary focus is on sustainable energy and grid stability, we recognize the importance of education and lifelong learning in achieving a more sustainable future.

One way in which Sourceful contributes to SDG4 is through our commitment to educating and empowering individuals and communities to take control of their energy resources. By providing access to information and tools that enable individuals to invest in renewable energy sources and participate in the decentralized energy grid, we are helping to promote awareness and understanding of sustainable energy and its benefits.

Additionally, we recognize the importance of promoting education and research in the field of sustainable energy. Through collaborations with academic institutions and research organizations, we aim to support the development of new technologies and solutions that can help to address the environmental challenges facing our world.

## SDG5 - Gender Equality

SDG5 aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. At Sourceful, we believe that achieving gender equality is essential for creating a more just and sustainable world. We strive to promote diversity and inclusivity within our team (even if we are not there yet) and our platform, and we are committed to providing equal opportunities for all individuals.

Through our platform, we hope to empower women and girls by creating opportunities for them to participate in the energy transition. By providing access to information and resources, we can help individuals take control of their energy resources and contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable future. Additionally, we believe that by creating a more equitable and inclusive energy system, we can help promote gender equality and support the empowerment of women and girls around the world.

## SDG6 - Clean Water and Sanitaion

SDG6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. At Sourceful, we recognize the importance of responsible water management and are committed to reducing our water consumption and protecting this vital resource.

While our energy gateway does not measure water usage, our decentralized energy system can indirectly contribute to better water management practices. By promoting the use of renewable energy sources, we can reduce the reliance on water-intensive power generation methods such as coal-fired power plants or nuclear power plants. This can help reduce the water consumption of the energy sector and support more sustainable water management practices.

## SDG7 - Affordable and clean Energy

At Sourceful, our main focus is on SDG7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. We believe that our decentralized energy system can play a crucial role in achieving this goal.
