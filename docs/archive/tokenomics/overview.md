# The tokenomic of Sourceful

:::caution
Please note that Sourceful is still in Beta and all token rewards should be concidered as non tradeable Beta-tokens.
:::

Welcome to the Tokenomics section of the Sourceful documentation! Here, we will explore the fundamental principles behind our token economy and how it supports our goal of creating a more sustainable energy system.

Tokenomics is the study of how tokens are created, distributed, and utilized within a particular ecosystem. At its core, it's about designing a token economy that provides the right incentives for all stakeholders, from founders and participators to developers and partners. Inspired by Helium, Sourceful will use burning mechanism when services are sold.
