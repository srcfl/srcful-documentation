# Problems to Solve

Sourceful aims to address several key challenges in the energy market, including barriers to entry, lack of incentives and user-friendly technology and costs.

### Barrier to enter
One major problem that Sourceful aims to address is the barriers to entry for renewable energy sources. Non-renewable energy industries hold significant market power and political influence, making it difficult for renewable energy to compete and gain a foothold in the market. In addition, integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into existing energy grids presents new challenges for legacy systems, such as the need for new markets to ensure grid stability.

### Lack of incentives
Another challenge that Sourceful aims to address is the lack of incentives and user-friendly technology for smaller producers to contribute with Ancillary services to the grid. Without these incentives, it can be difficult for individuals and organizations to justify the investment in renewable energy.

### Costs
Finally, Sourceful aims to address the high upfront costs associated with renewable energy adoption and the total cost for connecting DERs through third party. These costs can make lenders view renewables as high-risk, leading to higher borrowing rates and making it harder to justify the investment. By reducing these costs and addressing other barriers to adoption, Sourceful hopes to make renewable energy more accessible and widely adopted.
