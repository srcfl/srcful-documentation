# The Solution

### Remove barriers to enter
Sourceful gives individuals the ability to take control of their energy production and contribute to the grid through the use of distributed energy resources (DERs). By linking the VPP to a blockchain and verifying the contribution of DERs, Sourceful aims to inject decentralization into an industry that is currently dominated by monopolies. Through this community-driven approach, individuals can shape the development of next-generation energy services.

### Create incentives
Sourceful also aims to provide the right incentives and user-friendly technology for smaller producers to contribute flexibility services to the grid. Inspired by the token economic structure used to build the world's largest IoT-network ([Helium](https://www.helium.com/)), Sourceful offers a cost-effective solution for individuals to connect their DERs through the inverter and be rewarded for making their flexibility available. This approach allows for a more efficient and decentralized energy system.

### Lower costs
Finally, Sourceful aims to address the high costs associated with renewable energy adoption through the use of approved complementary hardware and a sustainable economic model. By becoming a member of the Sourceful community and connecting their DERs, individuals can receive compensation for contributing to grid stability. The business model do not require extracting margin from hardware or installation costs, making the energy system more cost-effective for all participants. Overall, Sourceful's approach offer a range of features and benefits that aim to address key challenges in the energy market and facilitate the transition to a more decentralized and sustainable energy system.
