# Sourceful Energy Gateway

The Energy Gateway developed by Sourceful is a state-of-the-art Internet of Things (IoT) device that is designed to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the grid. The Energy Gateway communicates directly with PV-inverters or battery storage systems through the use of the Modbus protocol, allowing for the transfer of data and control signals between the device and the energy generation or storage system.

To ensure the reliability and security of the Energy Gateway, Sourceful utilizes both the Helium network and WiFi for communication and verification purposes. The Energy Gateway connects wirelessly to the LoRaWAN network via the Helium network, which is designed to support low-power, long-range IoT applications. In addition to the Helium network, the energy gateway also utilizes WiFi for data transfer and verification purposes.

One key feature of the Energy Gateway is the presence of a crypto-chip, which is used to sign all transactions that are sent from the device to the validator. This crypto-chip plays a crucial role in ensuring the authenticity and integrity of transactions, providing a verifiable source for all energy generation or storage data.

Overall, the Energy Gateway is a technical marvel that combines state-of-the-art hardware and modern frameworks to facilitate the integration of DERs into the grid. Through the use of the multiple communication protocols, user friendly hardware, cryptochip and blockchain technology, the energy gateway is able to securely and reliably transfer data and facilitate transactions within the decentralized energy system.
