# Token Rewards

## Beta phase rewards
During the beta phase, active beta testers and early adopters will be rewarded a set amount of Beta points monthly for their engagement in the project. Read more about this in the <a href="../../tokenomics/rewards/">Tokenomics</a>.

## Post-Beta Phase: ENERGY Token

Upon the official launch of the utility token ENERGY, Beta phase points will be replaced by the ENERGY token. Sourceful Energy will offer two main ways for participants to benefit from the network: baseline rewards and energy services.

### Baseline Rewards
Baseline rewards are designed to incentivize consistent participation in the Sourceful Energy network. When you connect your renewable energy source (like solar plant or a battery storage) to the network, you'll earn rewards for data sharing. These rewards are based on factors such as: uptime, quality and value

- How long you've been connected to the network
- The quality and frequency of the data you provide
- Validation mechanism

By providing this valuable data, you're helping to create a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the decentralized energy landscape, which is crucial for improving grid efficiency and stability.

### Energy Services
Energy services will represent the larger portion of potential rewards and involve actively participating in Energy services such as grid stabilization and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) activities. Here's how it works:

- After connecting to the network and meeting certain qualifications, you can opt to make your energy resource (like your home battery) available for grid services.
- Energy companies and grid operators can then utilize your resource as part of a larger Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to help balance the grid during times of high demand or to integrate more renewable energy.
- When your resource is used for these services, you earn additional rewards, even if your specific device isn't called upon. It's like being on standby to help the grid - you're rewarded for being available and ready to contribute.

By participating with your DER in the VPP, you're not selling your energy. Instead, you're offering the ability to help stabilize the power grid, and you get rewarded for that availability and contribution. 

Through these reward mechanisms, Sourceful Energy aims to create a win-win situation where individuals are incentivized to contribute to a more sustainable and resilient energy system, all while earning rewards for their participation.

## The ENERGY token will facilitate access to a range of services within the Sourceful ecosystem:

- Rewards for DER Integration: Contributors will earn rewards for connecting Distributed Energy Resources (DERs).
- Rewards for Services: Contributors will earn extra rewards for participating in selling energy services such as grid balancing.

### Future services for DER Owners:

- Advanced energy resource monitoring and analytics
- Performance deviation notifications
- Benchmarking tools for installation comparison
- Solar energy production optimization
- Access to an exclusive energy service marketplace

### Future services for Energy Companies:

- Aggregation of DERs to provide grid stability services
- Access to aggregated real time energy data and insights
- Integration capabilities for third-party energy management system
- Renewable Energy Certificates.

### Mint and Burn Equilibrium
The ENERGY token will employ a Mint and Burn Equilibrium mechanism to maintain a balanced token supply:

Minting: New tokens are minted to reward contributors for connecting DERs and providing energy services.
Burning: Tokens are burned from the supply when paying customers from the demand side of the energy network use Sourceful's services.

This dynamic equilibrium helps ensure the utility token's value remains stable while incentivizing both supply-side contributions and demand-side usage of the Sourceful ecosystem.
