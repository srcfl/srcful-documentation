# API Documentation

## Overview
The Sourceful GraphQL API provides access to production data from various energy assets. It is designed to be flexible, allowing users to query the data in various resolutions and time frames. This documentation explains how to interact with the API using GraphQL.

### API Playground
For testing and experimenting with queries, you can visit the [API Playground](https://api.srcful.dev/playground). This tool allows you to execute queries interactively and inspect results, making it easier to translate queries into your application code.

## Authentication
Currently, authentication is not required for basic access, but we plan to add authentication mechanisms in future iterations.

## Querying the API
The API uses GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need.
