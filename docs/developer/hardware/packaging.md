# Zap Packaging Guide

This guide covers the packaging process for Sourceful Zap devices after firmware flashing.

## Prerequisites

Before packaging, ensure:
- Zaps are successfully flashed (see [Flashing Zap Firmware](/developer/hardware/flashing-zap-firmware))
- CSV file with device information has been sent to provisioning team
- Packaging materials are available:
  - Cardboard boxes
  - Spring fill (~20 grams per box)
  - "Get Started" cards

## Packaging Process

### Step 1: Fold Cardboard Box

Assemble the cardboard packaging following the standard box folding procedure.

  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild2.jpg" alt="Box folding step 2" width="200" />
  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild3.jpg" alt="Box folding step 3" width="200" />
</div>

### Step 2: Add Spring Fill

Add approximately **20 grams** of spring fill to the box for cushioning.

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '20px', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '20px 0'}}>
  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild4.jpg" alt="Adding spring fill step 1" width="250" />
  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild5.jpg" alt="Adding spring fill step 2" width="250" />
</div>

### Step 3: Insert Get Started Card

Place the "Get Started" information card in the package.

<div style={{display: 'flex', gap: '20px', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '20px 0'}}>
  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild6.jpg" alt="Get started card placement step 1" width="250" />
  <img src="/img/hardware/Bild7.jpg" alt="Get started card placement step 2" width="250" />
</div>

## Quality Control

Before sealing the package, verify:
- [ ] Zap device is properly placed in the box
- [ ] Spring fill provides adequate cushioning
- [ ] Get Started card is included and visible
- [ ] Device serial number matches CSV records (if tracking)
- [ ] Box is not damaged
