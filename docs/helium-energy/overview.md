# Introduction

## HIP 128: Energy Subnetwork

Srcful has introduced a [**Helium Improvement Proposal**](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0128-energy-subnetwork.md) (HIP) that aims to create **ENERGY**, a new subnetwork within the [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) ecosystem. This innovative subnetwork focuses on rewarding users who participate in solar power production and battery energy storage, enhancing the integration of renewable energy resources. 

By enabling dual mining for existing compatible Helium Hotspots, allowing for both IOT and ENERGY rewards, the ENERGY subnetwork will utilize Helium’s IoT infrastructure to transfer vital sensor data, drive increased Data Credit (DC) burn, and contribute to grid stability.

Our proposal aim to leverage Helium’s decentralized model to create a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) from small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), empowering homeowners and expanding Helium’s market reach. This initiative aligns with global sustainability goals and promises significant economic benefits, positioning both Srcful and Helium at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution.

## Helium Community

All Helium Improvement Proposals are openly discussed and voted on by the Helium community. This collaborative process ensures that each proposal is thoroughly vetted and reflects the collective input and consensus of the community. By participating in these discussions and votes, community members play a crucial role in shaping the future of the Helium network.

Join the [**Helium Community Discord**](https://discord.gg/helium) to join in on the discussions.
