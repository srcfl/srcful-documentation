## Who can gain access to your personal data and why?

Sourceful will process your personal data. When a third party, such as our IT and system suppliers, processes your information on our behalf, we have signed a data processing agreement with them. This means that they are obliged to process the information securely, accurately, and confidentially.

Our data processors are:
- Google Workspace - cloud services.
- Google Analytics – cookies.

We also transfer your personal data to recipients who are not processors. The recipients are independent data controllers for their processing. Such recipients include, for example, public authorities if such disclosure is required by law, banks, and payment service providers.

## Transfers of personal data to countries outside the EU or EEA (“third countries”)

As a general rule, we and our suppliers and partners process your personal data only within the EU/EEA. In cases where personal data are processed outside the EU/EEA, we base the processing either on a decision from the European Commission that the relevant third country ensures an adequate level of protection, or appropriate safeguards, e.g. standard data protection clauses, to ensure that your rights are protected. 

In the following cases, we may transfer personal data to third countries:
- Personal data, such as e-mail addresses, that is provided by customers in Google Forms or in e-mail correspondence with us might be transferred by Google to the USA. The transfer is based on a decision from the European Commission that the relevant third country ensures an adequate level of protection as Google is subject to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. 
- If you use our website and have consented to us using Google Analytics, your personal data may be transferred by Google to the USA. The transfer is based on a decision from the European Commission that the relevant third country ensures an adequate level of protection as Google is subject to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework.

If you wish to receive a copy of the safeguards taken by us or information regarding where these safeguards have been made available, please contact us by using the contact details stated below.
