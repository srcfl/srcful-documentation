<i>Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.</i>
</div><br />

SDG11 aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Srcful's decentralized energy system aligns with this goal by promoting sustainable energy practices in urban areas. By connecting small-scale renewable energy producers to the grid, Srcful reduces reliance on centralized power plants and promotes the use of clean energy sources in cities. This can help to reduce pollution and improve air quality, making cities healthier and more sustainable places to live.

In addition, Srcful's energy marketplace may in the future enable energy sharing between communities, promoting inclusivity and helping to ensure that everyone has access to clean, affordable energy. This can be particularly important in urban areas where energy poverty can be a major issue. By providing a platform for peer-to-peer energy trading, Srcful can help to democratize access to clean energy and promote social and environmental sustainability in cities. It is important to note that this is not yet implemented.

Furthermore, the clustering of DERs enabled by Proof-of-Control (PoC) can help to increase grid stability and resilience in urban areas. By providing a flexible and reliable source of energy that can ramp up and down to meet changing demand, DER clusters can help to balance the grid and reduce the risk of blackouts and other disruptions. This can be particularly important in areas with high population densities, where power demand can be highly variable.

Overall, Srcful is committed to fulfilling the goals of SDG11 by promoting sustainable energy practices, inclusivity, and resilience in urban areas. By providing a platform for decentralized energy sharing and management, Srcful can help to create more sustainable and equitable cities for all.
