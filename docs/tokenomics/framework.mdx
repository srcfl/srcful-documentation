# Points System Framework

The Sourceful DER Network points system is designed to incentivize participation, ensure data quality, and promote network growth through a carefully balanced reward mechanism. This document outlines our approach to creating a fair, sybil-resistant points allocation system that evolves with network maturity. This system will evolve and change based on network needs and goals.

## System Evolution

Our points system is being implemented in distinct phases to accommodate network growth and changing priorities:

1. **Beta Phase** (Current): Establishing core incentives for early adopters
2. **Transition Phase**: Introducing advanced mathematical models while maintaining continuity
3. **Enhanced System**: Implementing comprehensive framework with advanced anti-gaming protections
4. **Advanced Framework**: Integrating multi-dimensional metrics with dynamic weighting

## Conceptual Framework

The enhanced points system is built on three foundational pillars that balance immediate needs with long-term objectives:

### Mathematical Foundation

For any participant *u* at time *t*, points are allocated according to:

$$Points(u, t) = \alpha_t \sum_{i=1}^{N_G} G_i^u(t) + \beta_t \sum_{j=1}^{N_Q} Q_j^u(t) + \gamma_t \sum_{k=1}^{N_S} S_k^u(t)$$

Where:
- $G_i^u(t)$ represents growth-oriented metrics
- $Q_j^u(t)$ represents quality-oriented metrics
- $S_k^u(t)$ represents sustainability-oriented metrics
- $\alpha_t, \beta_t, \gamma_t$ are time-dependent weighting coefficients

This formulation allows us to gradually shift emphasis from growth to quality and sustainability as the network matures, with:
- $\alpha_t \approx 1$ in early phases
- $\beta_t$ and $\gamma_t$ increasing over time

### Sybil Resistance

Our system incorporates mathematical protections against sybil attacks through strategic application of aggregation and dampening:

$$Score(u, t) = f\left(\sum_{i \in D^u(t)} M(i) \times N(i, t)\right)$$

Where:
- $D^u(t)$ is the set of all devices connected by participant *u*
- $M(i)$ is a multiplier based on device characteristics
- $N(i, t)$ is a contribution measure for device *i* during period *t*
- $f(\cdot)$ is our chosen dampening function

This approach ensures that:
$$f\left(\sum_{i} x_i\right) < \sum_{i} f(x_i)$$

Making artificial fragmentation of contributions mathematically disadvantageous.

## Validation Framework

The system includes a validation multiplier that rewards verified data sources, balancing between:

- Incentivizing third-party verification
- Maintaining accessibility for diverse participation
- Creating appropriate differentiation based on data quality

## Daily Allocation Mechanism

Points are distributed from a fixed daily pool using a proportional allocation:

$$Reward(u, t) = \frac{Score(u, t)}{\sum_{u' \in U} Score(u', t)} \times DailyPool$$

This ensures consistent total distribution while dynamically adjusting individual allocations based on relative contributions.
